====WEEK 2====

This week, we are covering some of the basics of strings and string
manipulation. Check out the poetry.py, a script that takes a phrase
that the user writes, checks it for the number of iterations of the
letter "a" and compares it to a series of default phrases. The script
demonstrates some of the cleaner string manipulation features of
python.

String manipulation consititutes a great deal of the menial work that
our SaaS application will need to do. If we are scraping from news
sources (or from Tweets, say), we will need to be able to process
strings go get the desired results. In the coming weeks, we will take
a look at ways of extracting from social media and the web, before
diving in to creating the product on Django.
