====FINTECH APP: THE START====

This is the first articulation of the Django app that we are trying to
build. The approach I took is to start by completing the Django
tutorial https://www.djangoproject.com/start/ and this application
contains the content from part 1 and 2 from that tutorial. I hope to
complete part 3 and 4 by the end of this week, and then migrate what
I've learned from Django to the Fintech application.

We chose Django in the first place because it a) uses python (giving
us access to the libraries we want for data science) b) automatically
supports an API (useful for manipulating the data) c) automatically
supports a CMS (useful if you want to build ...users). Follow the
steps mentioned earlier to install and configure Django, and feel free
to refer to this code to explore the different features of the
application.

Note that the polls file contains the tutorial content. Soon, I will
create a second file that merges the polls tutorial with the Twitter
and Scraper content earlier to produce a tool that visualizes data
scraped from a target website.
