====WELCOME TO SHIFTKEY-PY: HACKIFY YOUR BUSINESS====

This is a Python tutorial designed to introduce senior business students to Python programming. The motivation behind this tutorial is that business students fundamentally do not think like developers: we like to see the big picture and have no interest in writing perfect code. The tutorial is designed to teach key concepts in Python using concrete examples each week for 12 weeks. Each example will be designed in a way that students can modify the file to add additional functionality. Material from each week is provided in a folder along side some writtend ocumentation. The tutorial also makes use of a number of existing resources such as Google's Python Class and Django's documents. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand and build a functional web app in Django.

This is very much a work in progress. We will be updating the tutorial each week for the next few weeks, adding more content even after the Winter session is complete.
