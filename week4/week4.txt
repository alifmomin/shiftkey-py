THE FINANCE NEWS EXTRACTOR

This is a simple scraper script that demonstrates python's ability to extract and parse web data using regex. As we discussed on Tuesday,
regular expressions are used to sort through large amounts of text data using a notation. In the case of this script, we use regex to
discount irregular items from the news elements.

The cool thing about the finance extractor is that it's not too complicated, but potentially very powerful. What happens if we extract 
time series news data from company websites, and merge these with stock performance information ? Can we identify a relationship between
these things? What if we include Twitter data? Can we potentially build FinTech software that can be used to make a lot of money?

In the coming weeks, we are going to switch gears to Django. If we use tools together with Django, we can build a fully fledged web app.
It will be a bit of a crude app, but if you also apply analytics libraries, it demonstrates how you can use python to build the "next big
thing" in a sector like FinTech.*

If you're reading this online and missed the discussion, google FinTech to understand why we might want this.
